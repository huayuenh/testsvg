template.name: "1:Develop a Kubernetes app"
template.description: "2:With this toolchain, you can develop and deploy an application securely into a Kubernetes cluster managed by the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js \"Hello World\" app, but you can also bring your own app and link to it instead. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery with [Vulnerability Advisor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/va?topic=va-va_index), [Code Risk Analyzer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd-configure-cra-repos), source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\n You can manage your IBM Cloud Container clusters using the [console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [classic-tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/use-develop-kubernetes-app-toolchain) or [tekton-tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/tutorials/use-develop-kubernetes-app-toolchain-with-tekton-pipelines)."
template.gettingStarted: "3: **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new Docker image build, which will be scanned for vulnerabilites and deployed in your Kubernetes cluster. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/use-develop-kubernetes-app-toolchain?task=2) for this toolchain."
